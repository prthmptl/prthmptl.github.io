- OpenAI API for natural language understanding

### Database
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- SQL for query execution

### Development
- Python for core logic
- Git for version control

## How It Works

1. **User Input** - User asks a question in natural language
2. **Schema Understanding** - Agent analyzes database schema
