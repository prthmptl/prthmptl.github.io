# Hello!

I'm Pratham Patel, a Data Scientist at Bacancy Technology with a passion for building AI-powered solutions that solve real-world problems.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Engineering from Charotar University of Science and Technology (2020-2024). My journey in tech has led me to work on exciting projects ranging from computer vision systems achieving 70% accuracy in metal defect detection to NLP-powered meeting analysis platforms that save teams 3+ hours weekly.

I specialize in machine learning, natural language processing, and building enterprise-grade no-code ML platforms. I've collaborated with cross-functional teams of 10-15 engineers and delivered solutions deployed across major organizations including Kyndryl and Xyzies.

Thanks for stopping by!
